    "## Introduction and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent based modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will learn agent based modeling (ABM). What is ABM? Put it simply; an agent based model is a model which uses autonomous agents who follow simple rules to interact with eachother. The goal is to observe behaviours which arises in systems consisting of many interacting agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with a small system, in our case a few people(agents) trying to become rich, we use ABM to model a tiny economic system which we later upscale and add complexity to. As wikipedia states:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        \"\"Agent-based models are a kind of microscale model that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena.\"\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "Observing these complex phenomena or emergent bahaviours is the first step in understanding and analyzing the system. This is what makes ABM so powerfull, it gives us a quick way to model large complex systems with emergent behaviours. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Emergent behaviour\n",
    "Emergent behaviour is a scientific term used to describe systems who produce complex patterns or \"behaviour\". In our assignment we will observe this phenomenon with the emergence of an oligarch in our economic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The yard sale model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will recreate an economic system using ABM. This economic system will be based on the yard sale model developed by the phycicist Anirban Chakraborti. The system works by assuming that wealth transfers from one person to another by overpaying or underpaying for the traded goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are buying a toaster from someone at a yardsale, you pay 100 NOK ($\\approx$11 USD) for it, however the toasters \"real\" value is 120 NOK ($\\approx$13.5 USD), which means that in a way you have the potential to earn more money by selling it at its actual market price. So value has transfered to you because you underpaid for an item. The seller however has just lost value since they sold it below market price. This is how the model bases its value transfer, by either over or underpaying for items. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chakraborti also assumed that the people trading would only trade a relative portion of their wealth since no one or very few people wishes to declare bankruptcy. What he found however was that even when the winner was decided by the  flip of a coin the money tended to coalesce to one agent. So in effect this created a system where one person would become an oligarch. Our goal is to recreate this emergent behaviour and modify the system to see if we can curtail the growth of an oligarch. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why model real world systems?\n",
    "In a world where computers are becoming evermore powerful there will one day come a time where people can model a complete society and try to use the results of that model to improve our real world. This technology will eventually let us try different societal structures and policies to test them without harming any people. In recent history many different political theories on how societies should best be run have sprung up and we all live in the wake of the trial and error of of them. This technology however of modeling economy, society and much more will allow us to circumvent this and perhaps try out more and more models and impliment what we learn from them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting example can be found in this article where machine learning is used to determine the best tax policy: https://blog.einstein.ai/the-ai-economist/ , this article is not needed to understand and complete this assignment, but it might give you some ideas on how to add complexity to your model.\n",

    "## Expanding our model with a wealth limit (softcap)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we wish to modify our system through a wealth limit, where when the wealthy hit the wealth limit, some of their possessions gets redistributed to the agents at the lower parts of the socioeconomic spektrum. So the first thing to discuss is the very nature of the limit, is it going to be a hardcap or a softcap, where a hardcap would mean that they could never ever go over the wealth limit and a softcap would mean that they can go over, but there would be a system which activly works to bring them under again. Yet in theory if an oligark has a bit of luck and wins many times in a row he or she could theoretically exist over the wealthcap for a time, yet this is highly unlikely. Again we go to the real world to solve this problem through a thought experiment, let us imagine a state where the government has decided to implement a wealth limit with a hardcap. This would mean that if a wealthy person suddenly hits the wealthcapasity through their salery or other means, then the government would just stop that transfer and say something like \"sorry, you have hit the maximum amount of allowed money, have a nice day\". I can not imagine that this would go down too well with anyone, yes if the limit was arbitrarily large most people would be unaffected, yet it still seems tyrannical and it sounds like the government is more authoritarian than most would like, so perhaps a soft wealth capasity would be better? After all you are allowed to make money, even when you are over the capasity, it is just that it slowly repositions your value through some means of redistribution to a place under the wealth limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "So this begs the question, how do we make this soft wealth limit? Lets start by initiating the system as we did before, after all this will be a modification of the earlier system, the new additions to the initiation code will be a limit variable which defines the wealthroof, we will later define the wealthroof by using the limit variable as a coefficient to the wealth median. A percentage variable should also be included, we naturally need to siphon the money away from the people over the wealthlimit, this percentage should be low, **as low as 1% or even lower**. The next thing to add is a part of the optional section of this task so it can be neglected if wanted, but add 3 empty lists, these will be used to store who is at the wealth median, who is under it and lastly who is at it.\n",
