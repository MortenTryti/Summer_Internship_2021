# Summer Internship 2021: Modelling an economic system with multiple agents using the Yard sale model
### Collaborators: Morten T. Berg, Henrik Haugerud Carlsen and Tor Ole Odden

Here is the code for the summer internship I had at UiO CCSE where we made exercises in economic modelling using agent based modelling and the Yard sale model.

You can find the completed work under the file Emergen Behaviour ABM as an instructor file. Not all of the economic models made it in to the final draft, to explore further extensions of the model, look at the file Oligark-modell (2).ipynb in the Drafts folder.
